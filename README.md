 📝 My Awesome To-Do List App!Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little project—a simple but super useful To-Do List app built with Python. I made this using Tkinter (Python's built-in GUI library) to practice creating a clean, functional desktop tool.No need to keep those sticky notes scattered everywhere! This app helps you track what you need to get done, right on your desktop.🌟 What Can It Do?Quick Add: Type your task, hit Enter (or the 'ADD' button), and boom—it's on the list!Easy Checking Off: Done with a task? You can either click the ✅ MARK COMPLETE button or just double-click the task itself. I tried to make it super fast.Visual Tracking: I used colors to make it easy on the eyes: Red for pending stuff and bright Green for completed wins!Scoreboard: A handy little counter at the bottom keeps a real-time score of your progress: Total tasks, how many you've crushed, and what's still waiting.Cleanup Crew: There's a 🗑️ CLEAR ALL button for those satisfying fresh starts.🚀 Wanna Run It?You don't need much, just a standard Python setup!What you need:Python 3 (Tkinter comes with it, so no installation headaches!)How to get it going:Grab the Code:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Fire it Up!Bashpython todo_app.py 
# (Just run the file where the code is saved!)
🎨 Under the Hood (For the fellow nerds 😉)I structured this using a class (TodoApp) to keep everything tidy. The tricky part was making the list look nice and handle colors!The List: I used the ttk.Treeview widget—it's like a spreadsheet in your app. This lets me add custom tags ('pending' or 'completed') to color the rows.The Data: To keep things reliable, I store the actual status in a simple Python list of dictionaries, which keeps the data separate from the pretty UI.ColorSectionVibeBlueHeader"Official Task Zone"TealInput Area"Where the magic starts"OrangeList Header"The big list"Light GreenCounter"Good job tracking!"
