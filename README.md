 🎉 My Awesome To-Do List App!Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little passion project—a simple but super useful To-Do List app built completely with Python's standard Tkinter library. I made this as a fun way to practice creating clean, functional desktop tools.It’s perfect for getting things out of your head and onto the screen!🌟 What Makes It Cool?Quick Add Magic: Type your task, hit Enter (or the 'ADD' button), and BAM—it's on the list!Easy Check-Off: Done with a task? Mark it ✅ COMPLETE instantly! You can either use the button or just double-click the task row (my favorite way!).Color-Coded Vibe Check: I used bright colors to keep the list clear: Red for the pending hustle and Green for those satisfying finished tasks!Real-Time Scoreboard: The counter at the bottom keeps an eye on your progress—how many tasks total, how many you've crushed, and what's still on the list.Fresh Start Button: The big 🗑️ CLEAR ALL is there when you're ready to wipe the slate clean.🚀 Wanna Give It a Spin?It's super easy to run since it only needs standard Python!What you need:Python 3 (Tkinter comes pre-loaded, so no extra installs necessary!)How to get it running:Grab the Code:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Fire it Up!Bashpython todo_app.py 
# (Just run the file where the code is saved!)
💡 How I Built It (For the fellow coders 😉)I kept everything neat and tidy using the TodoApp class (OOP FTW!).The Brains: All the task info (the text and whether it's done or not) lives in a simple Python list of dictionaries called self.tasks.The Looker: The list you see is a ttk.Treeview widget. This widget is great because it lets me use tags (like 'pending' and 'completed') to apply those dynamic colors to the rows.The Colors: I defined a custom palette up top, so the app has a distinct, segmented look: Blue header, Teal input area, and a Green stats bar.SectionColor VibeHeaderBlue 🟦Input AreaTeal 🩱List HeaderOrange 🟠CounterLight Green 🟢
