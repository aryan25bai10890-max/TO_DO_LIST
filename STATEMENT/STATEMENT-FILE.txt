Project Statement: Colorful To-Do List Application
 Purpose and Goal
The objective of this project was to develop a desktop-based personal productivity tool that provides an intuitive and visually engaging way for users to manage their daily tasks. The application aims to enhance task organization and tracking through a clear, color-coded graphical interface.
🛠 Technology and Architecture
Core Technology: Python 3.x with the Tkinter and tkinter.ttk libraries.
Design: The application follows an Object-Oriented structure, encapsulated within the TodoApp class.
Data Handling: Tasks are stored in-memory as a list of Python dictionaries, ensuring fast, dynamic updates.
Interface: A ttk.Treeview widget is used for displaying tasks in a tabular format, featuring status-based color tagging (Red for Pending, Green for Completed) configured via ttk.Style.
